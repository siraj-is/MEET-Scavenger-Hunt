# 🗝️ MEET Scavenger Hunt: Step 1 — The Missing Key

Lill has lost her room key somewhere in Nave Shalom, and it’s up to you to find it.

All we know is this:
The last time Lill remembers having the key was in the cafeteria. So naturally, that’s where the search begins.

After a careful sweep — under the tables, behind the coffee machine, even near the suspiciously loud microwave — you come up empty-handed. The key is definitely not here.

But just as you're about to leave, someone calls out to you.

Well… not someone.
Something.

A burnt piece of toast sitting on a plate turns toward you and says:

“Psst. I saw a TA take the key. But I’m not telling you who it was…
not until you fix my code.”

It wiggles slightly, as if pointing toward the strange snippet of broken code below.

Your mission begins here.
To move forward in the hunt — and learn which TA took Lill’s key — you must debug the toast’s code.

Good luck, and welcome to Step 1.
